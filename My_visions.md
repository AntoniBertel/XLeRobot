# My Visions for XLeRobot, and a World for Embodied AI

> [!NOTE] 
> Currently still working on it, there might be incorrect information. I will detele this note after I wrap up everthing. But I will still just directly write here so you guys can see my progess.

> [!NOTE] 
> Below are all my **original personal thoughts**. I haven't shared it with anyone except my family and some close friends (not strutured or detailed even to them). I will start to pubilcly seek possible collaborations after a month.

This will not only be a plan of this project, but also a plan of the career path for myself, also a plan of how all of you (individuals, universities, companies, organizations, etc) can possibly participate in this project to push for the greater good of humanity.


## Urgent TODOs

- Rice's legal team is helping me to have a patent to better protect this idea/project from commercial misuse.
- Basic control integration by official Huggingface/Lerobot team to make it one of the official hardware platforms in Lerobot, similar to Lekiwi right now.
  - In contact, haven't confirmed this though. I can also do it myself quickly.
- Integration to Maniskill GPU accelerated simulation platform (with urdfs also able to use on other simulators) for RL training.
  - They already have support for SO100 arm.
  - In contact, haven't confirmed this though. I can also do it myself quickly.

## What we could expect in 2 months

- People around the world start to play with it and we will start see some interesting demos.
- LeRobot Hackathon on 6.14~6.15. This will officially be the time we can see how XLeRobot can unleash its potentials
  - or that it still has many limits that we need to work on in the future

## Plans for 6 months (maybe before ICRA submission deadline on 9.15?)

- Officially integrate and finalize basic control approaches such as GPU simulation, VR control, etc
- Officially integrate VLA algorithms (such as pi0 fast, maybe pi0.5)
- I/Rice RobotPI lab will also try to integrate our research on Caging in Time and Funnel-based manipulation approaches.

## Plans for a year

- Two ways towards intelligence: both of them have potentials and limits, we can carry them out in parallel to see which way is better. The world will keep working on with both of them on XLeRobot.
 - VLAs and End2end, such as RDT, Pi0.5, GR00T, etc, what the world has been working on over these years.
 - Physics-aware world models. Kind of like what Yann Lecun has been advocating, but it can happen in many different ways, not limited to JEPA.

- Fast applications approach: limit the task area and the number of the tasks for now. We don't expect general intelligence happens in a year, but we can quikly make the practical applications happen in everyone's homes (with enough robustness, stability and safety ensurance).

## Plans for beyond

- How to bulid an entire open-source household robot product tree based on XLeRobot
- How should this project be carried out by investors/large companies
