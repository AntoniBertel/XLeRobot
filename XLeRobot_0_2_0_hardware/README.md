### üìã Updated Bill of Materials (BOM)

The BOM is essentially the same as [XLeRobot 0.1.0](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot/blob/main/BOM.md), with the following additional components:
- [RealSense D415 depth camera](https://a.co/d/hzuPDe6)
- [Anker USB hub](https://a.co/d/6tJW8lN)
- [Hand cameras](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/Wrist_Cam_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module)
- 2 additional motors (same specifications as arm motors)

With all of these additional sensors and motors, the total cost of XLeRobot 0.2.0 is still less than $1,000, and this hardware setup should enable XLeRobot to autonomously perform many indoor household tasks.


### üîß Hardware Updates

#### Bottom Base
- **Improved base plate layout**: All screws can now be installed smoothly without interference
- **Added branding**: XLeRobot (Zima) watermark and designer name have been added to the base plate

#### Top Base
- **Standardized arm spacing**: Two arm bases are now connected to ensure consistent spacing

- **Clamp mounting system**: Retained clamp-based attachment for easier installation and modular design
- **Integrated cable management**: Added protective shell for Raspberry Pi with organized cable routing

- **Hollow neck design**: Space-efficient design that saves filament while accommodating USB hub

- **2-DOF head rotation**: Direct modification based on SO101 base design

- **Modular architecture**: Even if head functionality isn't immediately needed, you can print and assemble everything below the neck first

### üî® Assembly Instructions

#### Hardware Requirements
- Continue using M3 hex screws as in previous versions
- Bottom base assembly process remains the same as [version 0.1.0](https://github.com/Vector-Wangel/XLeRobot/blob/main/Assembly.md#%EF%B8%8F-install-the-lekiwi-base-)

#### Top Base Assembly
Follow the assembly sequence shown in the diagram below (easier when filpped over):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1640d830-b7e9-474b-810d-070097fec59e)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8a3c68f-9fe6-47da-9428-920e9658d58f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d305cb-c222-4641-81a4-682850ddbf37)

Then it should be the same as the first two steps of [SO101 arm assembly](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101#joint-1).


> [!NOTE] 
> Complete all wiring and put the Raspberry Pi in its case before clamping the top base to the IKEA cart.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
Due to ongoing LeRobot system updates, we are currently working on control integration with the new system version. Complete end-effector control code and corresponding simulation will be released this month.

**Temporary Workaround**: You can continue using Lekiwi's code base. For now, implement head control and base movement control separately (either disable base motors or disable head motors during operation).

### üöÄ Coming Soon
- Full control algorithm release
- End-effector control code
- Simulation environment
- Integration with updated LeRobot system
