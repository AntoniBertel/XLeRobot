## ü§î Before Printing 

> We assume you have basic experience with consumer-level 3D printers (BambuLab, Prusa, etc.). This means you know how to properly 3D print STL files with PLA filaments and are familiar with reorienting parts, adding supports, adjusting infill, and modifying print speed to achieve your desired balance of material strength, efficiency, and model detail quality.
> 
- For more detailed information, you can check out the 3D printing instructions for [Lekiwi](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/LeKiwi/blob/main/3DPrinting.md) and [SO101 Arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100#printing-the-parts).
- All the 3D printed parts shown in the demo videos and pictures of XLeRobot were printed with a **BambuLab A1 using BambuLab PLA Matte Black**.
- You can also use filaments with better mechanical properties, such as [**PETG HF, PLA CF**](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-cf), etc., to enhance the arm's strength.
- Drying PLA is recommended for humid environments at 55¬∞C for 8 hours before printing.

## ‚è´ XLeRobot Overview



```{note}
If you haven't printed SO101 arm or Lekiwi base, you can also refer to their instructions ([Lekiwi](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/LeKiwi/blob/main/3DPrinting.md) and [SO100 Arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100#printing-the-parts)) along with this tutorial.
```

## ü¶æ SO101 Arms

- In the current hardware version, you only need to print two follower arms. The [leader arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#printing-the-parts) is only necessary if you plan to operate the dual arms simultaneously with leader-follower joint control. Before printing, rearrange the layout of this stl file in the slicer software for your best printing experience.
- You can find the installation guide for [the Wrist Camera Mount here](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/Optional/SO101_Wrist_Cam_Hex-Nut_Mount_32x32_UVC_Module).

## Arm Base

### Arm Base

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e77b51-c070-4fbf-8487-30af3721f239)

- 2 arm bases are connected for standardized arm spacing.
- A middle storage shell for computational devices and cable management.
- You can insert a used Bambulab filament cardboard spool for additional structural support.


### Neck
    




## Wheel Base

- This component connects the Lekiwi base's top plate to the IKEA cart bottom. It's an enhanced version of the Lekiwi base motor mount, redesigned for better stability.

```{note}
If you're using a not an authentic IKEA cart, you can adjust the z-axis scale in your slicer software (while maintaining the xy-axis scale) to ensure even pressure distribution between the Lekiwi base and cart wheels.
```

### [Thinner Lekiwi base top plate](https://www.notion.so/vectorwang/3D_Models/3D_models_for_printing/XLeRobot_special/base_plate_layer2_thinner.stl)

- This is a thinner version of the standard Lekiwi base top plate, used to secure the connectors to the IKEA cart bottom.

- While the current connection between the Lekiwi base and cart is stable, an upcoming second version will simplify installation on the cart's metal mesh bottom.
