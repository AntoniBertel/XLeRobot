# Flattening Data

A suite of common wrappers useful for flattening/transforming data like observations/actions into more useful formats for e.g. Reinforcement Learning or Imitation Learning.

## Flatten Observations

A simple wrapper to flatten a dictionary observation space into a flat array observation space.


## Flatten Actions

A simple wrapper to flatten a dictionary action space into a flat array action space. Commonly used for multi-agent like environments when you want to control multiple agents/robots together with one action space.

## Flatten RGBD Observations

This wrapper concatenates all the RGB and Depth images into a single image with combined channels, and concatenates all state data into a single array so that the observation space becomes a simple dictionary composed of a `state`, `rgb`, and `depth` key.
