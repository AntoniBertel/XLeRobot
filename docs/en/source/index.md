## 🌟 Why XLeRobot? 🌟

Let's break this down since **XLeRobot = XL + LeRobot**

### Why "LeRobot" Core?

- **Cheap Materials** 💴: 90% 3D printed components with affordable motors and electronics.
- **Easy Assembly** 🔨: 67 minutes to assemble 2 SO101 arms and configure motors.
- **Plug-&-Play** 🧩: Get robots running with simple pip install and a few lines of code.
- **Thriving LeRobot Community** 🌍:
World's largest low-cost robotics community featuring
    - Multiple [state-of-the-art pretrained AI models🧠](https://huggingface.co/lerobot), datasets📊, and tools🔨 ready for deployment.
    - 10k+ brilliant minds for brainstorming and discussions🧑‍🤝‍🧑.




### Why "XL" Enhancement?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b48a0a41-7422-4f10-8dc6-a66a2fd746ad)

- 🏠 The field/market lacks affordable, stable, dual-arm home robots that match LeRobot's ease of assembly.
- 🖨️ Traditional 3D printed chassis suffer from limited durability, stability, and load capacity—making them impractical for daily use.
- ⚡ DIY mobile robots face power supply challenges, leading to complex wiring setups.
- 🤖 **XLeRobot** maintains compatibility with the LeRobot community's tabletop dual-arm SO-100/SO-101 configuration, enabling seamless code and policy transfer.

### Overall Advantages of XLeRobot

- **Cost-effective** 💴: Complete build costs \$660, or upgrade from existing SO100Arm and Lekiwi for \$250.
- **Easy upgrade** ⏫ (physical and electrical) for **Lekiwi** and **SO-100/SO-101**
    - Hardware: No motor ID changes or hardware modifications needed
    - Software: Identical tabletop single-arm/dual-arm setup—transfer your trained policies directly from SO-100/SO-101 arm
- **Practical and reliable** 💪: Performs many daily tasks comparable to $30,000 market alternatives.
    - More tasks demonstrated in the LeRobot hackathon in [Shenzhen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9v04Rc3xA&ab_channel=SeeedStudio), [Shanghai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oXvINlYsls&ab_channel=SeeedStudio) and [San Jose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvzhsDliGII&ab_channel=SeeedStudio)([Winners](https://www.hackster.io/contests/embodiedAI#winners)), and the [first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3D94400vq0&ab_channel=HuggingFace).
    - **Note**: Not currently designed for in-hand dexterity 🤹, heavy lifting (over 1kg per arm) 🏋️, or highly dynamic movements 🏃
- **Rich open-source resources** 📕
    - LeRobot's plug-and-play code🧩 and extensive AI model library🧠
    - Backed by an active, growing community of contributors🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- **⚠️Safety always matters⚠️**: XLeRobot has inherent physical hardware limitations (low-torque motors, short arm length, wheel-based) that make it physically almost incapable of harming humans, while still maintaining its ability to perform many household tasks.

## 🎯 Who is XLeRobot For?

- 🚀 **Startups & Labs**: Build prototypes faster with the world's cheapest modular platform
- 👩🔬 **Self Researchers**: Experiment with embodied AI without breaking the bank 💸
- 🎓 **Education Heroes**:
    - High School Teachers: Bring cutting-edge robotics to STEM classes 🧪
    - University Professors: Affordable platform for robotics/AI courses 📚
    - Students: From beginners to researchers 🎒→🎓
- 🤖 **DIY Enthusiasts**: Perfect for indoor projects - plant care, delivery bots, home automation 🌱📦

---

## Limitations

(Hey, for this price, what more could you ask for?)

- 🔒 Fixed height—adding a stable lifting platform would significantly increase costs and assembly difficulty
- 📏 Smaller workspace compared to Aloha—while we maximize the SO100 workspace, the arm has size limitations, though XLeRobot still handles most tasks effectively
- ⚖️ Limited payload capacity for a single arm—that's why we use the IKEA cart
- 🛒 Base movement precision may be affected by the IKEA cart wheels—this can be addressed through closed-loop feedback control

All things considered—cost, community support, ease of assembly, and practical utility—XLeRobot stands out as one of the most compelling low-cost robot for indoor application!
