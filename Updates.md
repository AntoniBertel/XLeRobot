## Upcoming Updates for XLeRobot 0.2.0

- Minor upgrades on 3D models for better assembly and cable management
- Standard dual-arm base with a RasberryPi Holder and safety stop button
- Head camera with Realsense depth camera
- URDF and basic Simulation in Maniskill
- More teleoperation demos
- A small surprise

From XLeRobot 0.1.0 to 0.2.0, the same existing lekiwi code will be used, and hardware upgrade modifications will take less than half an hour, so interested users can go ahead and get familiar with 0.1.0 first. After version 0.2.0 is released, the hardware will be improved to truly become an open-source platform with its full capability, shared by both hobbyists and professional robotics researchers - stay tuned!
