From XLeRobot 0.1.0 to 0.2.0, the same existing lekiwi code will be used, and hardware upgrade modifications will take less than half an hour, so interested users can go ahead and get familiar with it. After version 0.2.0 is released, the hardware will be improved to truly become an open-source platform shared by both hobbyists and professional robotics researchers - stay tuned!
