## Notes

- The .3mf file contains soft finray fingers that need to be printed with TPU95A. If you want original SO101 finger, just download the original SO101 .stl file.

- The .3mf file contains 2 version of the single RGB head camera connector and shell, one for webcam & realsense, the other for the cheaper camera same as the hand camera.
- No need to adjust the base connector this time, just print the washers and insert them into the IKEA cart for the best base support.
