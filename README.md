This is the open-source repo for XLeRobot, including hardware desgins, bill of materials, modified LeRobot codes, etc. Currently actively working, planning on finish the first version XLeRbot 0.1.0 in a week, please be patient....

# XLeRobot 🤖
**🚀 Bringing Embodied AI to Everyone Cheaper Than the iPhone! 📱**

Built upon [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot), [SO-100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100), [Lekiwi](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/LeKiwi), and [Bambot](https://github.com/timqian/bambot). This project could not be possible without standing on the shoulder of giants!

## 🌟 Why XLeRobot? 
**We're on a mission to build the world's most affordable general-purpose applicable household robot** 🏡✨  
Imagine a modular, dual-arm mobile robot that costs less than your smartphone! By combining open-source magic 🧙♂️, IKEA hacks 🛠️, and modern AI algorithms 🤖, we're making robotics accessible to **EVERYONE**.

### Key Features:
- 🎯 **Cheapest DIY Robot Base**: Built on the IKEA RÅSKOG Cart ($39) - cheap but stable, available worldwide 🌍
- 🤝 **Massive Open Community**: Collaborate with thousands robot researchers and enthusiasts via [LeRobot Community](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)
- 🔋 **24/7 Power**: Utilize Anker power stations & solar panels ☀️ (Bonus: Use the battery for camping! ⛺)
- 🧩 **Lekiwi-Based Wiring**: For wiring it's the same as a single SO100 arm + Lekiwi, no need to rename your existed motors.

## 🎯 Demo Video 0.0.5

This is currently just a single arm version of directly implementing Lekiwi, teleoped with another arm 
(FYI: The follow arm hardware can be also used as the leader arm, the only difference is that it's geared so there will be some resistance)
