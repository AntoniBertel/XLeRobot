## Install Lerobot 

- Skip it if you have pip installed Lerobot on your PC in the Assembly section. 

- If not, follow this [installation guide](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/10_use_so100.md#b-install-lerobot)

## Finish everything required on Lekiwi

- The first preview verison of XLeRobot doesn't have codes yet (will rollout within a month). So it 100% rely on the Lekiwi codebase.
- Follow all of their [software instructions](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#b-install-software-on-pi) so you can:
  -  [Install software on RasberryPi[(https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#b-install-software-on-pi) and setup SSH (which could be a little difficult for a computer newbie, but the instructions of Lekiwi have some great tutorials)
  -  [Install LeRobot on PC](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#c-install-lerobot-on-laptop)
  -  [Update config](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#update-config)(we are the mobile base version, not wired version)
  -  [Calibrate](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#e-calibration)

  After these step you should be able to run a basic single arm version of teleoperating XLeRobot [the same way Lekiwi does](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/11_use_lekiwi.md#e-calibration).
